                    For all indoor cats, cat litter is a must-have item. A cat's natural nature is to
                    bury its urine and faeces in it, however some owners have preferences for the type of
                    litter their cats should utilise.

                    Price, odour control, dust content, absorbency, clumping ability, purchase availability,
                    aroma (or lack thereof), and other factors may all influence the sort of litter you or your
                    cat prefer.

                            Clay cat litter is the most popular litter among cat owners,
                            owing to the fact that it is also one of the most readily available litters.
                            <br>
                            Clay cat litter comes in two varieties: clumping and non-clumping. Many cat
                            owners choose clumping cat litter because they like to scoop the urine waste 
                            out of the litter box on a regular basis, but others prefer non-clumping litter 
                            since it is less expensive and allows them to discard the entire litter box contents 
                            when necessary.

                            Several companies produce silica gel cat litter, which is gaining in popularity. Most 
                            companies claim that silica gel litter is less dusty than clay, that it traps urine 
                            without the need to scoop it out of the litter, that it lasts longer than the same amount 
                            of clay litter, that it provides excellent odour control, and that it is sometimes even 
                            preferred by cats over clay litter.

                            Silica fibre litter is normally more expensive than clay litter bags of the same weight, 
                            but some pet owners don't notice the difference because it lasts longer.

                            Paper litter, which is popular for cats with paw injuries, can be processed, recycled paper 
                            material, or simply shredded newspaper. These litters have little dust and are less likely 
                            to irritate wounds than clay litters. They also have no smells, are softer than clay litters, 
                            and are absorbent. Unfortunately, because these litters do not clump or regulate odours 
                            properly, they are frequently utilised only for a limited period of time.
