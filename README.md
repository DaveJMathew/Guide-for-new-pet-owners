# Guide-for-new-pet-owners
(Static Website)

The goal of the website is to provide a beginnerâ€™s guide to pet ownership to new owners so that they may decide on whether they would like to adopt a pet and to help prepare them for it. 

The target audience for this site are persons with near to no knowledge or experience in caring and owning a pet, but would like to a introduction into the roles and qualities of owning one.

The site would provide them with a brief summary of why they should own a pet, different types of breeds of the pet, what type of food the pet would require to eat, and such basic things.

The site was implemented using HTMl, CSS and JS
