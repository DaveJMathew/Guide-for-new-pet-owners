            <h1>Reasons To Own A Cat</h1>
            <p>Cats are one of the most wonderful pets you can have. If you're unsure about 
                taking on the responsibility of owning a pet, consider the advantages of having 
                a cat. A cat's purr can melt your heart since they are lovely, quiet, and 
                independent. The following are the top five reasons to get a cat.</p>

                <!-- Cat Reasons List-->

                    <dt class="page-list-items">
                        1. Cats love independence
                        <dd>

                            If you don't think you have the time or energy to care for a pet, 
                            a cat might be the answer. Taking care of a cat takes less effort 
                            than caring for other animals. Those who work full-time can relax knowing 
                            that their cat can look after itself for the most part. When you do have some 
                            spare time, cuddling up with your cat will feel much better.

                        2. Cats are all about being clean
                        <dd>
                            Cats are remarkably clean almost all of the time. 
                            That means you'll never have to take time out of your day to bathe 
                            and groom your cat.

                    <dt>
                        3. Cats are natural predators
                        <dd>
                            If you don't like rats, chipmunks, voles, or mice in your house, getting 
                            a cat will solve that problem straight away.To make you proud, your cat
                            might even bring you its trophy!

                        4. Cats voted for the Greens
                        <dd>
                            Living a "green" lifestyle might be challenging, but a cat is an excellent
                            choice for eco-conscious pet owners. According to studies, the resources
                            required to feed and care for a cat have a lower carbon footprint than 
                            those required for other animals. Furthermore, most cats prefer fish to 
                            beef because it is healthier for them. You can be proud of your feline
                            companion.

                        5. Cats are perfect de-stressors
                        <dd>
                            We're all stressed out at times, and people have a variety of coping 
                            mechanisms. Cat owners can de-stress by just petting their feline 
                            companion's head. Petting a cat causes your brain to release endorphins,
                            which helps you feel better. Cats' fur is also the softest!
