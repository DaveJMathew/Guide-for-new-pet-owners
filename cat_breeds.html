                            Tabbies are noted for their stripes, swirls, and dots, which come in an almost
                            unlimited variety of colours and patterns. Their coats feature a single main
                            hue with brown and black colour stripes. Brown mackerel markings are the most
                            common.
                            Tabbies are easily distinguished by their gentle demeanour and the fabled 
                            capital 'M' on their furry brow.
                            
                            Every sort of family, even those with children and other pets, can find a 
                            tabby.

                            Siberian cats are native to Siberia, a region of Russia noted for its long, 
                            severe winters, as their name suggests. Their lengthy, waterproof triple coat 
                            and powerful bodies reflect their rugged beginnings.

                            The personalities of these alert, well-built cats are kittenish. This breed is 
                            affectionate and enjoys cuddling. Siberians are dedicated to their pet parents 
                            and get along well with children and other animals in general.

                            The British shorthair is one of the most popular cat breeds in the world. 
                            They have a thick, fluffy short coat as well as a cheerful, no-nonsense
                            sensibility towards life. British shorthairs make excellent family cats and 
                            enjoy spending time with their owners, however they may frown upon being 
                            handled or cuddled excessively.

                            The original British shorthair is coated in blue fur, but this lovely breed 
                            comes in a range of hues and patterns. The nice factor is that this medium-to-large 
                            cat has hardly any health issues.

                        <article>
                            Persian cats have been snuggling up with their owners since the 1600s, making 
                            them one of the most well-known and adored cat breeds on the planet. It's 
                            difficult to resist the allure of a Persian with their long, flowing coats, 
                            heavy bodies, and flat faces.

                            Persian cats are a medium-sized breed that takes their position as a loving 
                            companion very seriously, and they're always willing to be petted and fussed 
                            over at any time. When introduced as kittens, this lovely feline comes in a 
                            range of colours and colour combinations, and they get along with all 
                            family members (including other furry ones). You won't find a more 
                            affectionate friend if you're prepared to put in a little effort with grooming

                            The Siamese cat is a beautiful, intelligent feline with a pleasant personality
                            who attracts people wherever they goes. These cats are recognised for being "dog-like"
                            and for requiring a lot of attention—human companionship is something this breed craves.

                            Siamese kittens are a popular breed . The Cat Fanciers' Association ranked the Siamese 
                            as the 13th most popular cat breed. It's easy to see why they're so popular, given their 
                            warm nature.

                            Ragdolls are big, affectionate cats with a lot of patience and gentleness. Despite their size,
                            these cats are a placid and quiet breed that enjoys nothing more than playing and cuddling with
                            their owners.

                            This breed is known for being easy to care for and extremely social. They make wonderful family 
                            pets and get along with kids. If you give this fluffy feline your time and attention, they will 
                            repay you with eternal loyalty and affection.
