                    There are numerous aspects that influence a toy's safety or danger. 
                    However, many of those elements are entirely dependant on your cat's size, 
                    activity level, and personal preferences. The environment in which your cat 
                    spends their time is another aspect to consider. Although you cannot guarantee
                    your cat's enjoyment or safety with any particular toy, you might be able 
                    to make use of the following suggestions.

                            Plastic rolling balls, with or without bells inside, empty cardboard rolls
                            from toilet paper and paper towels and sisal-wrapped toys are very attractive
                            to cats that tend to ignore soft toys.

                            Pouncing, concealing, and interactive play can all be done with paper bags. 
                            They're a good distraction if you need your cat to focus on anything else. 
                            Plastic bags are not a good idea because many cats enjoy chewing and ingesting them.

                            Stuffed animals are useful for a variety of reasons. The stuffed animal for certain 
                            cats should be small enough to transport. The stuffed animal should be around the
                            same size as the cat if the cat wants to "kill" the toy. Toys with legs and a tail 
                            appear to appeal to cats much more.

                            Make only four or five toys available at a time to rotate your cat's toys on a weekly
                            basis. Keep a range of sorts close at hand. If your cat has a big favourite, such as
                            a soft "baby" they like to cuddle with, you should usually keep it out all the time 
                            or risk their anger! Provide toys with several functions, for as one to carry, one to 
                            "kill," one to roll, and one to baby.

                            Hide and Seek is a fun game to play with your kitties. Found toys are frequently more 
                            appealing than toys that have been openly offered.
